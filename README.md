The task we are assigned is to find out how to deliver 40 packages using 3 trucks and two drivers while optimizing mileage and time. The restrictions are as follows:
•  Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages.
•  The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour.
•  The trucks have an infinite amount of gas with no need to stop.
•  Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.
•  Drivers leave the hub at 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed. The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.
•  Delivery time is instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery (that time is factored into the average speed of the trucks).
•  There is up to one special note for each package.
•  The wrong delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. The correct address is 410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111.
•  The package ID is unique; there are no collisions.
